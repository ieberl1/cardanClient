<html>Simple <b>Java</b> application that includes a class with <code>main()</code> method
<pre>This program (eventually) will:
1. Ask user for input (w x y)
    w: web server ("s") (www.google.com)
    x: integer, where "z" = min(x, 1460) is the # of bytes C will send to "s" in every packet containing "w"'s page<br />
    y: timeout period in milliseconds
2. Send HTTP GET to "w" using HTTPURLConnection
3. When a line of the page is received use two threads to:
    a: Send packets w/ the line to "s" at UDP port 22333 ("z" bytes in each packet)
    b: Print page contents to terminal
4. If "c" does not get ACK before timeout period "y" expires; resend the last "z" bytes. If after this resend no
ACK is received send "FAIL" to "s" and quit.
5. Whenever an ACK is received from "s" print "ACK".
6. When all bytes have been sent, print "DONE" and total time taken from beginning of page transfer until last
ACK has been received, and total number of bytes in the page sent
